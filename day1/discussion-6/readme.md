## 2. Sensors and Parameters Monitored

### Temperature and Humidity
- **Sensor**: **DHT11**
  - **Parameters Monitored**: Temperature and Humidity
  - **Communication Protocol**: **I2C**
  - **Description**: DHT11 is a digital sensor ideal for environmental monitoring applications, providing temperature and humidity data for applications such as greenhouse management.

### Soil Moisture
- **Sensor Type**: **Analog Soil Moisture Sensor**
  - **Parameter Monitored**: Soil Moisture Level
  - **Signal Type**: Analog
  - **Description**: This sensor measures the water content in the soil, which is critical for maintaining optimal soil conditions for plant growth and irrigation management.

### Soil Nutrients (NPK Levels)
- **Sensor Type**: **NPK Sensor** with **RS-485** Output
  - **Parameters Monitored**: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) levels
  - **Communication Protocol**: **RS-485**
  - **Description**: The NPK sensor provides data on the soilâ€™s nutrient levels, allowing precise nutrient management in agriculture for improved crop yields.
